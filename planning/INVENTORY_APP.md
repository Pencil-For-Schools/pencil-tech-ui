## **Goal**
Develop an inventory system that tracks items available in the Pencil Box, manages stock levels, and records inventory intake activities.

### **Key Components:**
1. **Inventory Management**
2. **Item Intake and Adjustments**
3. **Location Management**

### **Implementation Phases**

---

### **Phase 1: Database and API Development (6 hours)**

#### **Main Tasks:**
1. **Set Up Database Tables**
   - [ ] **Create `inventory_item` table**:
     - Columns: `id`, `name`, `description`, `value`, `archived`.
     - Seed initial items for testing.
   - [ ] **Create `pencil_box_location` table**:
     - Columns: `id`, `name`, `address1`, `address2`, `city`, `state`, `zip`.
     - Add sample locations to test item distribution.
   - [ ] **Create `inventory_intake` table**:
     - Columns: `id`, `inventory_item_id`, `updated_by`, `donated_by`, `qty_donated`, `pencil_box_location_id`, `notes`, `updated_at`, `intake_type_id`.
   - [ ] **Create `intake_type` table**:
     - Columns: `id`, `name` (e.g., intake, adjustment), `description`.
   - [ ] **Create `pencil_box_location_inventory_item` table**:
     - Columns: `id`, `inventory_item_id`, `pencil_box_location_id`, `bin_number`, `low_stock`, `max_amt`, `sold`, `in_stock`, `last_audited`.

2. **API Endpoint Development**
   - [ ] **Develop `GET /inventory-items` endpoint**:
     - Fetch all inventory items with filtering options (location, archived status).
   - [ ] **Develop `POST /inventory-intake` endpoint**:
     - Log intake events, including donations and adjustments.
   - [ ] **Develop `GET /inventory-location/{location_id}` endpoint**:
     - View inventory status at a specific Pencil Box location.

### **Phase 2: Front-End Development (8 hours)**

#### **Main Tasks:**
1. **Inventory Dashboard**
   - [ ] **Design dashboard layout**:
     - Display item names, current stock, and alerts for low stock.
   - [ ] **Implement item list component**:
     - Fetch data from API and display inventory items.

2. **Item Intake Form**
   - [ ] **Build intake form**:
     - Fields: Item selection, quantity, location, updated by, donated by, and intake type.
   - [ ] **Form Submission Handling**:
     - Connect form to the backend to record inventory intake.

3. **Location Management Interface**
   - [ ] **Develop location overview page**:
     - Show inventory items available at each location with stock levels.
   - [ ] **Location details**:
     - Allow detailed view and adjustments of inventory per location.

---

### **Phase 3: Stock Management Logic (4 hours)**

#### **Main Tasks:**
1. **Stock Adjustment Logic**
   - [ ] **Implement stock calculation rules**:
     - Adjust stock levels based on intake events, sales, and adjustments.
   - [ ] **Low Stock Alert System**:
     - Highlight items that fall below the defined low stock threshold.

2. **Audit Functionality**
   - [ ] **Set up audit trails**:
     - Track all adjustments and intake actions with timestamps and user details.

---

### **Phase 4: Testing and Debugging (4 hours)**

#### **Main Tasks:**
1. **Front-End Testing**
   - [ ] **Test intake form validation**:
     - Ensure correct input handling and submission responses.
   - [ ] **Test inventory display**:
     - Verify accurate stock data is shown and updated in real time.

2. **End-to-End Testing**
   - [ ] **Simulate inventory management flow**:
     - From intake through to location-based stock adjustments.
   - [ ] **Edge case testing**:
     - Scenarios like high donation volumes or inventory discrepancies.

---

### **Phase 5: Deployment and Final Checks (2 hours)**

#### **Main Tasks:**
1. **Deploy Backend and Frontend to Production**
   - [ ] **Set up production environment**:
     - Ensure the database and APIs are correctly configured.

2. **Final Integration Testing**
   - [ ] **Test live system functionality**:
     - Confirm all data flows and stock adjustments work as expected.

3. **Launch System**
   - [ ] **Go live with the inventory system**:
     - Ensure all Pencil Box locations have access to the system for inventory management.

---

### **Stretch Goals:**
- **Unit Tests for Stock Management Logic**
- **Advanced Reporting on Inventory Trends and Adjustments**
